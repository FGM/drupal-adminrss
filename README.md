[![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/gp/adminrss/badges/quality-score.png?b=8.x-1.x&s=72afcc6fcfcb43994254af21b1f574552a8bca81)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/gp/adminrss/?branch=8.x-1.x)

The AdminRSS module creates RSS feeds for the administrative information
of a drupal website. These are protected with a key string that can be set at
the `admin/config/services/adminrss` page.

The resulting pages can then be fetched at:

- `adminrss/node/keystring`  - RSS feed for unapproved nodes
- `adminrss/comment/keystring` - RSS feed for unapproved comments
  
Since the key is transmitted often and in clear text, it should be complex and 
changed often.


# Installation

- copy the adminrss directory into the `modules/contrib` directory
- enable the `AdminRSS` module in Drupal
- go to `admin/config/services/adminrss` to set a keystring and the feed links
- configure your RSS reader to read the appropriate page


# Extending the module: additional Views

## Requirements

The module will automatically extend support for Views added to the site, as
long as they meet a few requirements:

- the view is tagged `AdminRSS`
- it contains at least one feed display, with the following requirements
  - its access handler is the AdminRSS handler
  - its path contains the `%adminrss_token` parameter

## Additional features

- the Display name (labeled Administrative name in the UI popup) is used to link
  to the feed
- its Administrative description (in the UI popup) is used as the title for the
  link to the feed

## Suggestions

In most cases, the goal of this module is to list normally unaccessible content,
without real-time emergency, so when adding new Views, set the following query
settings in the Advanced/Other pane in the Views UI

- Disable SQL rewriting: to access inaccessible content
- Use secondary server: to avoid filtering out yet unpublished content.

When in doubt, check how the supplied Views are built.

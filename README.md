# Description

The AdminRSS module creates RSS feeds for the administrative information
of a drupal website. These are protected with a key string that can be set at
the `admin/config/services/adminrss` page.

The resulting pages can then be fetched at:

- `adminrss/node/keystring`  - RSS feed for unapproved nodes
- `adminrss/comment/keystring` - RSS feed for unapproved comments
  
Since the key is transmitted often and in clear text, it should be complex and 
changed often.


# Installation

- copy the adminrss directory into the `modules/contrib` directory
- enable the `AdminRSS` module in Drupal
- go to `admin/config/services/adminrss` to set a keystring and the feed links
- configure your RSS reader to read the appropriate page
